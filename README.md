/* Group Contract Rules:
Let each person get a chance to speak and voice their opinion when making a decision.
Contact each other and discuss at least 1-2 times per week. 
Generally have fun and enjoy yourself
Help others if they don’t know what to do
 
Three things the group doesn’t want to happen:
We don’t want any members arguing with each other. We believe that we should always communicate and figure out solutions together.
 Each member should not start their part of the project the day before the due date. It should be at least 3 days before the due date.
We don’t want any members to refuse to work on a certain part of the project. 

We really hope that our group can communicate well and get along with each other, so that we can finish our projects on time and without any stress. 
We function well with groups that communicate well, work hard, reach out for help if needed, and finish their work on time.
